# IoT Node

The IoT Node board includes the most common peripheral components for IoT solutions and includes a stackable expansion header for your favorite communication module. Add stackable adapter boards to provide additional functionality. The IoT Node board is designed to fit a hinged waterproof enclosure.

The IoT Node is general purpose and may be used for wide range of IoT applications ranging from environmental monitoring to industrial control.

### Features

Some of the most important features of the IoT Node include

* Multiple power options including mains, solar, and battery.  Battery options include Li-poly and AA.
* Power regulation and management for peripherals and external devices like sensors. Switched 3.3V and 5V regulators.
* Non-volatile FRAM and micro-SD card memory for keeping track of state and for data logging.
* A real-time-clock for time keeping and for scheduled power control of the communication module and peripherals.
* A watch dog timer for reliability.
* Pluggable expansion headers for communication modules and for adapter boards.
* Screw terminals that breakout the pins of the expansion headers for flexible I/O.
* Header compatibility with the popular Adafruit Feather boards enabling the use of a wide range of peripherals and communication modules including the new Particle Wi-Fi, cellular, and mesh modules.
* Low power capability with communication modules operating in sleep mode.
* A rugged watertight enclosure.

### Communications Modules

The Adafruit Feather and new Feather-based Particle cellular, Wi-Fi, and mesh modules may be plugged directly into the IoT Node header. Making the communication module a separate plug in provides significantly flexibility and enables the use of the latest and greatest communication module in a market that is changing very rapidly.
